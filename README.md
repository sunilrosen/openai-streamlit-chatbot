  - Adjust the temperature to control the creativity level of the chatbot's responses.
- **Clear Chat History**: Allows for resetting the conversation history.

## Running the Application

To run the chatbot application, use the following command:

The chatbot interface will open in your default browser. You can interact with the bot by typing messages into the chat input box and customizing the settings in the sidebar.
